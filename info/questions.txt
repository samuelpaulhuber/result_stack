1. How will this be used? 
    - Is there a reason not to use github's interface for searching?
        - What is it they are lacking that is desired?
2. How many results should be returned?
    - Should the number of results be configurable by the user?
3. Should we add the following?
    - Company
    - Blog
    - Bio
4. Should this be designed around a mobile user first?
    - Would this make sense as PWA?
